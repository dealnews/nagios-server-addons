Gluster Nagios Add-ons:
=======================
Nagios server plugin, scripts, configuration files etc for gluster services.


Installation
============
The Nagios Server Add-ons can be used by following the standard
autotools installation process, documented in the INSTALL file. As a
quick start you can do

   ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc \
        --localstatedir=/var --libdir=/usr/lib
   make
   sudo make install


Packaging
=========
The 'nagios-server-addons.spec' file demonstrates how to distribute
this as an RPM package.

Sending Notifications to Ovirt Engine
=====================================

  Nagios can be configured to send notifications to Ovirt engine to notify important nagios events.

Configure the 'Ovirt' Contact defined in /etc/nagios/gluster-gluster-contacts.cfg with actual
ovirt details.

# Ovirt Engine Rest API URL

_ovirt_rest_api    #http://[ovirt-engine-address]:[port]/ovirt-engine/api
_ovirt_user        # username@domain

# Ovirt password has to be configured as a user variable USER3$ in file /etc/nagios/private/resource.cfg.

$USER3$ = [password for the user defined in contact 'Ovirt']

User variable  $USER3$ is used in commands to pass the password to the handler. If some other variable is
used to configure password than it has to be updated in the nagios commands 'notify-host-to-ovirt' and
'notify-service-to-ovirt' defined in file /etc/nagios/gluster/gluster-commands.cfg
